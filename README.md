# odin-recipes
In this project, I will learn how to use HTML to create a basic recipes website.
Once I complete the project, I should know how to create basic headers, emphasize text, and insert images.

Note: This project will be revisisted and styled with CSS once further progress in
The Odin Project is made

Reflection: In this project, I learned quite a bit regarding the HTML basics such as creating a hierarchy and inserting images. I also burned the git commands into my mind because of the little errors I made making it necessary to commit so many times. Overall, I found this project to be intriguing and I look forward to advancing my knowledge in The Odin Project.
